# Integrated-Machine-Learning-for-Healthcare-and-Sentiment-Analysis

In this project, we explore the application of neural networks to two critical domains: healthcare, through breast cancer detection, and sentiment analysis, via review classification. Leveraging the Keras Tuner's RandomSearch, we optimize our models to achieve high accuracy on validation datasets. This cross-domain approach underscores the flexibility and power of machine learning models to glean insights from complex, high-dimensional data. We also display the sentiment analysis on Flask locally.
